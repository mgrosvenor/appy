## About

A minimal high quality python script. This script can be used as a skeleton/starting point for writing high quality python scripts. 

It has the following features: 

1. Uses the python "__main__" idiom for an easy to follow structure
2. Add `eprint` function for printing to `stderr`
3. Captures SIGINT (and a few others) for graceful exit.
4. Adds basic argument parsing including `--verbose` and `--debug` modes for logging
5. Configures basic logging (using the above)

**Note**
There's no magic, and nothing clever about this. 
All just boring, basic, boilerplate. 
It's handy to be able to copy this and use it quickly.
