# Appy
A minimal high quality python script. This script can be used as a sekeleton/starting point for writing high quality python scripts. 

It has the following features: 
1. Uses the python "__main__" idiom for an easy to follow structure
2. Captures SIGINT (and a few others) for graceful exit
3. Adds basic argument parsing including `--verbose` and `--debug` modes
4. Configures basic logging (using the above)

There's no magic, and nothing clever about this. 
All just boring, basic, boilerplate. 

But it's handy to be able to copy this and use it quickly.
